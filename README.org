#+TITLE: Eddie is Eddie's (Emacs) directory developed in Emacs

* Introduction
By default Emacs kinda sucks. Most people customize the hell out of
Emacs. This is Eddie, my personal configuration of Emacs. Emacs is
customized by loading a directory containing Emacs Lisp code. That
directory is =~/.emacs.d= and it contains a an /initialization/ file
called =init.el=; the file where all the magic begins.
