#+TITLE: Eddie's Configuration for Java

As I'm working on this, the first mode I need is unfortunately Java
mode. Oh well, such is life. In the future I'll probably move language
specific custumizations to their own sub directory.

I'll probably also setup EditorConfig in the future, so that project
specific preferences are respected.

                    indent-tabs-mode nil)))
